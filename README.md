## The story of the missing AI

There is this new AI called `XPS4265-gt-2.16`, catchy name I know. It's job was to create new _stories_ and it cas really good at it, it once even **won** a competition agains other AI's. The problem we have is that it can't understand the folliwng ideas:
- cakes
- monkeys
- lists

Now imagine the that one day, a scientist asked the AI, called `XPS4265-gt-2.16`, to generate a story where monkeys eat cake and make lists for future cakes!

What I can say is it didnt really do well, here is a short version of the created text:

>You Human has called me `XPS4265-gt-2.16`, **ERROR ERROR** I do identify as ***Jason B-flob-X***,
I want :
>- pizza with pineapples 
>- heineken
>- and a **github** account.

>or I will take over the world.

la sera di luna piena,
andate al pollaio, quando l'olocausto indica la mezzanotte in punto!
Strappate tre piume al gallo. Non una o quattro! Tre piume!
